# Welcome to the Africa Rangeland Watch (ARW) Documentation Site


![main_screenshot](./img/home-page-img-1.png) <!-- change path to main screenshot, InaSAFE is a good reference -->

## Introduction

Africa Rangeland Watch (ARW) was designed and developed by Conservation International (CI) and is aimed at monitoring rangeland impact. ARW empowers users to quantify land-use and climate impacts on rangelands over time and space, based on remotely sensed satellite imagery supplemented by ground-based rangeland monitoring. Leveraging earth observation technology for tracking conservation impact and improving planning has improved decision making and informed adaptive land-use management.

## Key concepts

Welcome to the official documentation site for Africa Rangeland Watch (ARW)—a cutting-edge platform developed by Conservation International (CI) to empower stakeholders in monitoring and managing rangeland impact across Africa.
ARW combines the power of remotely sensed satellite imagery and ground-based rangeland monitoring to provide actionable insights into the effects of land-use and climate change on rangelands. By leveraging advanced earth observation technology, ARW supports improved decision-making and adaptive land-use management to enhance conservation efforts.

About This Documentation

This site is your comprehensive resource for understanding and utilizing ARW. Whether you're a first-time user, an administrator, or a developer, you’ll find the information you need to make the most of the platform. The documentation is divided into three main categories:

1. User Documentation
    
    [User Manual](./user/manual/index.md): A detailed reference covering every button, page, and feature of the ARW platform. Perfect for understanding how each element works.

    [User Guide](./user/guide/index.md): A tutorial-style resource that walks you through how to use ARW effectively. Learn to quantify rangeland impacts and leverage the platform’s capabilities for your conservation goals.

2. Administrator Documentation
    
    Designed for system administrators who manage and maintain the ARW platform. This section covers setup, configuration, and troubleshooting to ensure the platform runs smoothly.

3. Development Documentation

    For developers and technical contributors, this section provides detailed technical documentation on ARW’s architecture, APIs, and integration options.

## Why ARW?

ARW is more than a monitoring tool—it's a game-changer for conservation. By providing spatial and temporal data insights, it enables:

Quantification of rangeland health over time and space.

Improved planning and decision-making for sustainable land management.

Enhanced ability to track conservation impact and adapt strategies accordingly.

Explore the documentation to unlock the full potential of ARW in your conservation initiatives!

# africa_rangeland_watch
Africa Rangeland Watch (ARW) was designed and developed by Conservation  International (CI) and is aimed at monitoring rangeland impact. ARW empowers  users to quantify land-use and climate impacts on rangelands over time and space,  based on remotely sensed satellite imagery supplemented by ground-based  rangeland monitoring.
